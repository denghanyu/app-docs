# About Maps

## The aircraft's position on the map is not accurate

According to Chinese regulations, Chinese maps must adopt a special coordinate system, which does not match the aircraft's built-in coordinate system. So, the position of the aircraft displayed when using the map service in Mainland China may have a deviation of a few hundred meters. You can calibrate the position of the aircraft by adjusting the settings in **Coordinate Calibration (for Mainland China)**.

Where to find this Calibration option:

* iOS: Click the gear icon on the top right, and find the option of **Calibrate Coordinate (for Mainland China)**.
* Android: Click the three-dots icon on the top right. In **Map** settings, Find **Calibrate Coordinate (for Mainland China)**.

The method you choose depends on the map service you use, and sometimes, the network condition might also be taken into consideration. Therefore, we strongly recommend you to determine whether to turn on/ off the Coordinate Calibration option based on the aircraft's position shown on the map. Please be aware that ONLY ONE Calibration option is correct. If the aircraft's position  shown on the map is incorrect, you need to turn on the Coordinate Calibration option, and then re-observe the aircraft's position until it is displayed correctly.

In general:

* If you are using Gaode or Apple Maps: Need to turn on the Coordinate Calibration option.
* If you are using Google Map on an iOS device: Need to turn off the Coordinate Calibration option.
* If you are using Google Map on an iOS device: Need to turn on/ off this option based on the aircraft's location.
