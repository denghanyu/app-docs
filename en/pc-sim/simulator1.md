### Tips

* Here is a [DJI Guide](https://developer.dji.com/mobile-sdk/documentation/application-development-workflow/workflow-testing.html#aircraft-simulator)on using the simulator.
* Under the simulation mode, your aircraft will still take photos. So, after simulation, you may need to delete these photos to free up space in SD card.
* Scroll your mouse wheels to zoom in/out in simulator.
* Right click the simulator, select **Setup**, tick **Show Trace**, then you can see the flight path.
