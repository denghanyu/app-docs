# Using Altizure (for First Time Users)

## Activate Your App by Connecting to the Internet {#activate}

If you are using Altizure app for the first time, please make sure that your phone is connected to the Internet. This is because that before Altizure app is connected to the drone, DJI will check Altizure's API key and activate Altizure app on your device. This is required for all 3rd-party app using DJI SDK. If your Altizure app is not activated successfully, there will be a popup on the interface, saying that the activation is not successful. If there's no popup, you have activated your app successfully, congratulations!

When using Phantom 3 Standard or Phantom 3 4K, please DO NOT connect your phone to the drone's Wi-Fi if you are a first time user in Altizure app. Otherwise the activation may fail as the Wi-Fi on the drone is not connected to the Internet.

After a successful activation, you can use our app offline in the future.
 
安装完 Altizure app 第一次打开时，请确保网络通常。因为 app 在连接飞机前必须连接到大疆的服务器进行一次激活，否则无法控制飞机。如果激活失败，app 界面会弹出一个提示窗口，表明激活失败。如果没有弹出，则说明激活成功。

如果使用 Phantom 3 Standard 或 Phantom 3 4K 版，请在初次打开时不要连接飞机的 Wi-Fi。因为飞机的 Wi-Fi 没有连接互联网，会导致激活失败。

完成一次激活后便不再需要联网，可以离线使用。

## Login You DJI Account {#signin}

Due to the restrictions set by Chinese regulation department and DJI, you MUST login your DJI's account in Altizure app to unlock the drone-operating function. This is required for all third-party flight-planning apps in Mainland China. Or otherwise, the drone functions will be severely restricted by the firmware, and can only fly within a small range area. Image transmission function will also be disabled.

受中国大陆地区法规和大疆的要求，在中国大陆使用第三方 app 控制飞机飞行时，也必须登录大疆账号解锁无人机。否则，飞机的功能将被固件严重限制，只能在小范围内飞行，图传功能会被禁用。
