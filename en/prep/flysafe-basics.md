# Flight Safety (the Basics)

## Familiarize yourself with DJI UAV Operation Manual

Drone is not a toy that can be easily controlled. Its powerful engine and high-speed rotating propellers mean high risks in operation. So, for the safety of people and property, users must master their drone piloting skills before using the app.

## Before using Altizure App, you MUST be familiar with the following operations or functions:

1. Read DJI's User Manual, and familiarize yourself with the functions and operations of the remote controller and each drone component.
2. Be familiar with the UAV peculiarities and limitations. For instance, the drone may have unstable signal or even loses its signal when it flies outside the optimal transmission zone. Besides, users may not be able to stably control the drone when its signal is disturbed.
3. For mobile devices and software (including DJI Go), there will be time when it is not functioning properly. Users is recommended to learn how to control the drone without cell phone and image transmission, and they must be prepared with all kinds of situations, e.g. App Crash, app unable to connect to the drone, cell phone out of battery, etc.
任何移动设备及软件（包括 DJI Go）都有可能出现无法正常工作的时候。
4. Put yourself in a hypothetical emergency situation, and find the key to solving the problems. You can try those operations in safe places or in DJI Simulator.(You can find the tutorials on DJI Simulator in this Guide. Please try to use it.)
5. Be aware of the local policies and regulations. Please obtain the flight permission from relevant department before flying your drone.

## Things that you MUST know:

1. Without any app, how to takeoff/ land your drone only by using the remote controller?
2. After landing your drone without any app, how to stop the motor/ propellers only by using the remote controller? (In this case, please push the up/down stick down to the bottom. Please don't push the right stick to the bottom-left and left stick to the bottom-right)
3. Without any app, how to determine whether the drone is on Signal Lost? (You can observe the Status LED on the remote controller. This is more reliable than using app.)
4. Without any app, how to cancel/ execute the automatic Return-to-Home (RTH) operation?
5. What are the possible operations that might be executed by drones in Signal Lost?
6. When the drone is returning to Home Point, how many sounds can the remote controller make?
7. How to set the Return-to-Home (RTH) Height?
8. What are the drone operations and the Control Stick operations in each phase of flight?
9. During the RTH phase, the aircraft needs to climb to a certain altitude before safely returning to its last recorded Home Point at this altitude. Please be aware of the possible consequences that might be caused by operating the up/down stick.
10. What's the landing accuracy (i.e. the distance between the landing point and the takeoff point)?
11. What does Home Point mean and how to set it? When can the drone automatically set its Home Point location, and where's the location?
12. What's the GPS Signal Strength for safe flights?
13. How to calibrate the compass?
14. What's the difference between various flight modes on the remote controller (e.g. P-A-F, P-A-S, Sport)?
15. How to determine that your drone is in Danger or Warning Status according to the Aircraft Status Indicator on the drone?
16. How many types of Low-Battery warnings are there? After these warnings are triggered, what possible operations can I carry out with my drone?
17. Under what circumstances will the drone choose to land at its current location instead of returning to the Home Point? How to avoid losing your drone during this operation?
18. How will the battery voltage change during flights? What are the voltage conditions for safe flights?
19. What's the weather condition for flying drones? What potential danger you might face when flying in low temperature environment?
20. Without any app, how to lower/raise the landing gear only with the remote controller (Inspire series, Matrice series, etc.)?
21. What's the limitations on flight altitude and radius limits? How to adjust the limitation settings?
22. Why the GPS coordinates of your drone is inaccurate on the app map? How to set it right?
