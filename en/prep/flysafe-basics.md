# Flight Safety (the Basics)

## Familiarize yourself with DJI UAV Operation Manual

Drone is not a toy that can be easily controlled. Its powerful engine and high-speed rotating propellers mean high risks in operation. So, for the safety of people and property, users must master their drone piloting skills before using the app.

## Before using Altizure App, you MUST be familiar with the following operations or functions:

1. Read DJI's User Manual, and familiarize yourself with the functions and operations of the remote controller and each drone component.
2. Be familiar with the UAV peculiarity and limitations. For instance, the drone may have unstable signal or even loses its signal when it flies outside the optimal transmission zone. Besides, users may not be able to stably control the drone when its signal is disturbed.
3. It's possible for all mobile devices and software (including DJI Go) to be unable to work properly. Users is recommended to learn how to control the drone without cell phone and image transmission, and they must be prepared with all kinds of situations, e.g. App Crash, app unable to connect to the drone, cell phone out of battery, etc.
4. Put yourself in a hypothetical emergency situation, and find the key to solving the problems. You can try those operations in safe places or in DJI Simulator.(You can find the tutorials on DJI Simulator in this Guide. Please try to use it.)
5. Be aware of the local policies and regulations. Please obtain the flight permission from relevant department before flying your drone.

## Things that you MUST know:

Without any app,
1. **Takeoff** and **land** your drone only by using the remote controller.
2. After landing your drone manually, **stop the motor** only by using the remote controller. (Push the up/down stick down to the bottom. Please don't push the right stick to the bottom left and left stick to the bottom right)
3. Know how to determine whether the drone is in Signal Lost. (You can observe the Status LED on the remote controller. This is more reliable than using app.)
4. Cancel/ Execute the automatic Return-to-Home (RTH) operation.

请了解，不使用 app 时，
1. 只用遥控器，如何控制飞机起飞和降落？
2. 控制飞机着陆后，如何只用遥控器让螺旋桨停转？（油门降到底，请勿使用内八停机）
3. 如何判断飞机失去遥控信号？（观察遥控上的指示灯变化，比使用 app 更可靠）
4. 如何让飞机自动返航，如何取消自动返航？

Please understand:
5. The possible operations that might be executed by drones in Signal Lost.
6. When the drone is returning to the Home Point, how many sounds does the remote controller make?
7. The ways to set the Return-to-Home (RTH) Height.
8. Drone operations and the Control Stick in each phase of flight.
9. During the RTH phase, the aircraft needs to climb to a certain altitude before safely returning to its last recorded Home Point at this altitude. Please be aware of the possible consequences that might be caused by operating the up/down stick.
10. Landing accuracy (i.e. the distance between the landing point and the takeoff point).
11. The meaning of Home Point and ways to set it. The situations in which the drone can automatically set the Home Point location and the place of the auto-set Home Point.
12. The GPS Signal Strength for safe flights.
13. The ways to calibrate the compass.
14. Difference between various flight modes on the remote controller (e.g. P-A-F, P-A-S, Sport).
15. How to determine that your drone is in Danger or Warning Status according to the Aircraft Status Indicator on the drone.
16. Familiarize yourself with various Low-Battery warnings and the possible drone operations when these warnings are triggered.
