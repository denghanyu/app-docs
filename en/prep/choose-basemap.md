# Choose the Right Map

Flight Planning requires clear Satellite Map. As different map service providers provides different data, users can choose the map in Altizure app based on their own needs.

* iOS: Apple Map, Google Map
* Android: Gaode Map, Google Map

## Ways to switch between different maps

* **iOS:** Click the gear icon in the top-right corner. Choose a map in the popup window.

* **Android:** Click the menu icon (three-dots icon) on the top-right and enter "Map Settings". Choose a map in the popup window.

## FAQ

1. **Map is not displayed on the screen/ No satellite imagery data**

  First, please check the internet connection. As Altizure app does not have built-in maps, your map needs to be automatically downloaded from map service provider and cached before it can be displayed in app. In addition, after the data is downloaded, our app can load the cached data when there's no internet. Due to the limited space in mobile device, only the most recently viewed maps will be cached.

  If the satellite map is still not displayed on screen when the internet connection is good, the possible reason might be that the map provider does not have the satellite data in this area. Normally, Apple map and Gaode map only provide the maps of cities and some suburb areas, but not the rural and remote areas. Google map covers the widest region and has more frequent updates than other map service providers. So, we recommend users to choose Google map when Apple map and Gaode map are not working.
    
2. **Google map is not working. It's blank.**

  Due to legal restrictions, users cannot use Google map service in Mainland China. If you really want to use Google service, please try to find some other solutions.
