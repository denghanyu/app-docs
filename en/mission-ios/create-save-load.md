## Save/ Load Missions {#save-load}

After you finish relevant mission settings, please click **Save** at the top-right corner of your **Mission** panel. A popup window will then appear. After entering the mission name, you can save the mission in Altizure app.

Open the Mission List. You can find a mission by its name. Click **Load** to load the task.

## Unlock/ Edit Missions {#unlock}

After the mission is saved or loaded, you will find that the mission is locked for editing. This is to prevent the misoperations by users.

If you want to adjust these settings, please click **Edit** on top of the **Mission** panel, and enter the **Editing** mode. 

Besides, before executing the mission, please click **Save** to lock the settings. Or otherwise, you won't be able to continue the rest of the operations.

## Mission Files {#files}

Mission files are saved in the **Missions** folder in tablets. Every sub-folder (namely **missionXXX**, in which **XXX** is the sequence number) represents a flight mission. You can copy the mission settings, or move and share your flight missions to other devices by using iTuens or any other tools you like.
